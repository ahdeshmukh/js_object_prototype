Javascript objects are dynamic

eg: if you create a new object 
var dog = {name: 'Cable', breed: 'Lab/boxer mix'};

now, if you want to add age property, you do not need to add it to the object literal defined above. you can just do
dog.age = 1.5;

you can also add functions like
dog.speak = function() {
	console.log('Bark Bark');
};

and invoke it using dog.speak();
